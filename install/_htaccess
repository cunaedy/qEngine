# The installer should generate this file for you. If it didn't, you need to manually configure this file. Don't worry, it's easy!
# 1. Match { $path} to your installation folder on line #14 & #30
#    e.g
#    if you installed qE in http://www.myweb.tld/ (root folder)
#    use /
#
#    if you installed qE in http://www.myweb.tld/mysite/
#    use /mysite/
# 2. Rename this file to .htaccess
# 3. Copy/move this file to qE installation location. Done.
# Your server must be Apache and enable mod_rewrite.

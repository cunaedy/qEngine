## Features
**Free!**\
Yes, you read it right! This awesome script is totally free!

**Template Based**\
qE is templated based, separating the design from the php codes. You don't need to deal with php codes to build your web site. Concentrate on the design not on the script.

**Search Engine Friendly**\
Pages generated by qE is search engine friendly by masking a complicated URL by simpler & human readable URL.

**Lightweight & Fast**\
It's small (less than 2MB), fast & lightweight (most pages only need less than 0.01 seconds to generate with cache enabled & specific server configuration).

**Mobile Optimized**\
With mobile devices growing so fast nowadays, a mobile friendly web site is a must! qE's default skin is already a responsive design, and it also supports older mobile only design.

**Developer Friendly**\
Start developing your project instead of doing boring stuffs. qE has been equipped with most common CMS features: page management, news management, user management, template engine, SEO URL, web statistics, administration control panel, etc.

**Features Galore**\
qE also has hundreds of built-in functions, including cache, captcha, wysiwyg editor, long page pagination, qadmin to save your time developing simple stuffs, and more.

**Modules**\
qE also supports modules. While I'm writing this, there are already 20 modules available. More to come by user submissions.

**And More**\
SMTP mail support. ACP notification center. Complete changes log. And more!
